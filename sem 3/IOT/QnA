Questions from slide-share  (AVR programming)


1.	Configure PB as output port
->	DDRB=0xFF;	  or	0b11111111;

2.	Configure PC as tri-stated input and read value into variable x 
->	DDRC=0x00;
	PORTC=0x00;
	x=PINC;

3.	Configure PA as pullup input and read lower nibble into variable y and higher nibble into variable x.
->	DDRA=0x00;
	PORTA=0xFF;
	y=PINA & 0b00001111;
	x=PINA & 0b11110000 / 2^4

4.	Make higher nibble of PA as pullup inputs and lower nibble as output.
->	DDRA=0x0F;
	PORTA=0xF0;

5.	Read, only input pins of above mensioned port and get the binary number present on those pins into variable x.
->	x=(PINA & 0b11110000) / 2^4

6.	Write four bit number 0x5 onto output pins of above mensioned port.
->	PORTA=PORTA|0x05;
