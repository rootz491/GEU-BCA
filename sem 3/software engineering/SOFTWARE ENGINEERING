SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

*	free-ware software are free of cost, but only executable is given only {no source code} 
	open source software are software with open source code given.

*	'waterfall model', you have to specify all requirements in advance, 
	No way back, 
	it follow sequential model, 
	it was first model. 
		-> 	versions of waterfall model 

*	RAD model:	
		->	First take requirements from customer.
		->	Make plan to meet the requirements.
		->	divide product into multiple modules.
		->	group developers into few team to work on specific model/modules.	
 	  	->	assign them to groups of developers.

 	  	->	higher version of RAD -> CBSE {component based software engineering}
