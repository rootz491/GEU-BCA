#	Networking


>	ARP	:	address resolution protocol ->	used to convert ip address to it's Physical address (i.e. MAC address)

>	RASP:	Reverse Address Resolution protocol	->	it give ip address, given physical address as input

>	Internet protocol suite: layers-

	1.	Application layer:	concerned with data(URL, type, etc), where HTTP, HTTPS, etc comes in.	
	2.	Transport layer:	responcible for end-to-end communication over a network.
	3.	Network layer:		provide a data route.

>	URI:	uniform resource identifier	->	it's like address providing a unique global identifier to a resource on the web.
			URL is most common form of URI.

>	parts of URI:
	
	1.	PROTOCOL:	like HTTP
	2. 	Domain name:	www.google.com

>	FACTS about networking:
	
	*	Internet was invented by 'Tim Burners-Lee' in 1989.
	*	Internet is controlled by 75 million servers.
	*	The backbone of internet is made by 550,000 miles of underwater cable.
	*	About 3.2 billion people use the internet from which 1.7 billion internet users are Asians.

>	Transmission mode:	transferring of data b/w two devices.

	*	Simplex mode:	comm. is unidirectional, so on a one-way street.
		->	Example:	keyboard, mouse and old monitors.

	*	Half-Duplex mode:	Each station can both transmit and recievem but not at same time.
		->	when one device is sending, other can only recieve.
		->	the entire capacity of channel can be utilized in one direction.
		->	Example:	Walkie-Talkie.

	* Full-Duplex mode:		both stations can send and recieve at same time (simultaneously).

>	Cast:	stream of data being transmitted to the recipient from the client over comm. channel.

	1.	Unicast:	useful when there is participatio of single sender and sigle reciever.

	2.	Broadcase:	one to all transfer with same network.

		*	Direct Broadcasting:	when device in one network want to transfer packet steam to all the devices over the other network.

	3.	Multicast:	one or more sender and recipients participate in data transfer traffic.

>	access networks {like Home network}
	
	*	Ethernet:	Wired LAN technology, provides services on physical and data link layer of OSI model.
		->	It uses coaxial or twisted pair wires.

	*	DSL:	Digital Subscriber Line, basically telephone cable.
		->	DSL can carry both data and voice signals.
		->	In DSL, you can use internet and make phone calls simultaneously.
		->	Speed:	24 Mbps downstream, 2.5 Mbps upstream.

	*	FTTH:	fiber to the home. Uses optical fiber.
		->	High speed internet.

	*	Wireless LANs:	links two or more devices using wireless communication within a range.
		->	Uses high-frequency radio wave.

	*	3G and LTE:	Uses cellular telephony to send or recieve packets through nearby base station operated by cellular network provider.


>	tools:	
		1.	ifconfig	->		ip address and all sort of stuff of system.
		2.	netstat	-a 	->		list of all PORTS used by system.
		3.	nslookup <DOMAIN>	->	will return IP address of domain you pass. like DNS
